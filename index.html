        <h1>Sunday Night Dread</h1>
        <p>
            Have you ever gotten to the end of your weekend and suddenly been filled with a sense of terror?
        </p>
        <p>
            That frightening realization that your free time, your weekend, your <em>you</em> time is coming to an end.
            That time you cherish for betterment, learning, relaxation, anything besides toil and work... was over, and you utterly failed.  Again.
        </p>
        <p>
            You didn't use your time wisely.
        </p>
        <p>
            You procrastinated.
        </p>
        <p>
            You got lost in a cheap dopamine feed like 
            <select name="dopamine-feeds">
                <option>Facebook</option>
                <option>HackerNews</option>
                <option>Instagram</option>
                <option>Reddit</option>
                <option>YouTube</option>
            </select>, something, anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            You burned your most precious resource: time.
        </p>
        <p>
            And now sadness is filling your heart, and you feel <strong>Sunday Night Dread.</strong>
        </p>
