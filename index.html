            <h1>Sunday Night Dread</h1>
            <p>
                Future home of a knowledgebase for fighting the evil forces of procrastination with healthy habits.  Have you ever gotten to the end of your weekend and
                suddenly been filled with a sense of terror?  That frightening realization that your free time, your weekend, your time to get the things you cared about most
                is coming to a close, and you utterly failed, again.
            </p>
            <p>
                You didn't use your time wisely.  You procrastinated.  You got lost in Reddit, YouTube, HackerNews, something,
                any source of cheap dopamine.  You burned your most precious resource, time.  And now sadness fills your heart, and you feel <strong>Sunday Night Dread.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I've lived with this sense of dread for fifteen years, but I've finally learned how to kick it.  If you suffer from the same affliction, then read on.  I 
                have revelations to share.  I have a recipe for beating procrastination once and for all.  But first, let me tell you my parable of the perfect schedule.

            <h2>The Perfect Schedule</h2>
            <p>I used to think that my lack of productivity was a result of poor time management, poor discipline, poor willpower, maybe all three.</p>
            <p>Insert Story Here</p>
            <h2>Perceived Pyramid</h2>
            <p>
                You see my perception was that productivity is built on top of a bunch of false assumptions.  The pyramid I imagined in my head looked like this:

            <h2>Actual Pyramid</h2>
            <p>
                In reality, real human productivity comes as a result of a totally different stack or pyramid of conditions.  Real productivity looks like this:
