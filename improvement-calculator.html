        <h1>Improvement Calculator</h1>
        <p>
            This calculator illustrates the power of continual improvement over time.
        </p>
        <details>
            <summary>If you improved 1% every day at a certain skill, how much better would you be after 1 year? The
                answer might surprise you!</summary>
            <p>
                Many people will answer that they'd be about 3.5x better, because 1% every day adds up over 365 days to
                be 365% better (or about 3.5 times
                improvement), but most people don't understand how small improvements add up over time.
                Improvement is not additive. If you expect to be 3.5x better after a year, then you are assuming a
                linear rate of progress, but humans are
                really smart. As we get better at something, we actually compound the effects of our improvement.
            </p>
            <p>This is a lot like compound interest with money.</p>
            <p>
                Let's say it's Monday and you decide to become a painter. On Monday, you learn how to mix primary
                colors, such as red and blue, in order to
                form a secondary color like purple. On Tuesday, you learn brush strokes to draw shapes. By Wednesday,
                you've combined these skills and you're
                painting flowers. You're not just making new colors and shapes.
            </p>
            <p>
                You've compounded your Tuesday learnings on top of your Monday learnings to create artwork.
            </p>

            <p>
                In reality, with this compound effect in play, your improvement is actually exponential. If you get
                better 1% every day for a year, how much
                better will you be after 365 days?
            </p>
            <p>You'll end up <strong>thirty-seven times (37x) better</strong> after a year!</p>
            <p>
                Since progress or improvement is compounding, the formula to calculate your projected improvement over
                time is derived directly from how
                we calculate compound interest over time. When you practice daily, you are accumulating
                compound interest in a skillset.
            </p>

        <h2>Formula</h2>
        <p>Human improvement compounds over time. This simple formula expresses the surprising rate of human
            improvement:</p>
<pre class="formula">
Expertise x (1% Better) <sup>Time</sup> = Improvement
</pre>
        <dl>
            <dt>Expertise</dt>
            <dd>Current expertise as of the starting point of practice</dd>
            <dt>Better</dt>
            <dd>Percentage better (amount of improvement) every practice period</dd>
            <dt>Time</dt>
            <dd>Time expressed in number of practice periods (days)</dd>
            <dt>Improvement</dt>
            <dd>Final improvement after all practice periods</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>How many days can you get 1% better?</p>
<pre class="formula">
Expertise x (1% Better) <form id="progress" oninput="calculateProgress()" style="display: inline"><sup class="calculator"><input name="days" type="number" min="0" style="font-size: 1.4rem; width: 4rem" value="30"> days</sup> = <samp><output name="improvement" for="days">134</output>%</samp></form> Improvement
