            Learn to front-load your pain.
            <br />
            That's it.
            <br />
            If you procrastinate, you're putting off more than your work. You're putting off the pain. Right?
            <br />
            But doesn't it always catch up to you?
            <br />
            What you have to do is front-load all those yucky crappy feelings. Go ahead and feel it now so you don't
            have to feel it later. And guess what? If you put it off, it gets amplified. Right now you're dreading doing
            your homework or writing an article or w/e, but what if you don't do it? And worse, what if you put that
            stuff off consistently?
            <br />
            That thing you feel crappy about? That thing you're <strong>dreading</strong>? That is exactly the thing you
            need to do in order to improve your life.
            <br />
            It's a sign post.
            <br />
            Instead of dreading it, go ahead and embrace it. Embrace the yucky feeling and all. If you can do this for
            three weeks consistently, you will change your life forever.
            <br />
            If you embrace all that yucky stuff with gusto, your brain will take notice. Your brain is not static. it
            changes depending on what you focus on. The circuitry in your brain literally changes over time.
            <br />
            Finally, think of your actions as alchemy. You are taking time and adding energy to it to create a result.
            If you take action haphazardly, you will have a meh kind of life.
            <br />
            You know you're going to end up feeling like shit if you procrastinate anyway, so go ahead and do the thing
            you're afraid to do. If you're going to feel bad either way, you might as well take the action that will
            improve your life.
